# SkinSense

Our project arises from the idea of ​​creating a tool that can provide personalized guidance on what are the right products to use on your skin. Our project is made up of a device responsible for collecting temperature and humidity data in real time. This is made up of an ESP32, a microcontroller and a sensor, DHT11. It also includes an interactive user interface that, based on climate data, suggests an appropriate sunscreen and moisturizer.
